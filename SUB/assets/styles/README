This is the directory for all your static (CSS) stylesheets,
If you want compiled files to be written here you should set the path to your
theme directory (e.g. sites/all/themes) in your theme settings form in the
"Sass settings" section under "Path to store compiled files".
By default, compiled files are written to the public files directory.
