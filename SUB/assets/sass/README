##### Wraith - advanced drupal theming. #####

This is the directory for all your Sass stylesheets,
By default it contains a single .scss file already called from your .info file
but you may add as many css/scss/sass files as you want.
This is where sass will look for partials, so they should reside here,
preferably in the partials folder.
You may add an RTL version or an LTR version for both of them using
filename-rtl.css or filename-rtl.scss etc.
if you add a new stylesheet here, you must call it from the theme .info file.


##### Images #####

When adding images to your scss, be sure to use the Compass image helper. The
example below shows how to use an image found in the YOURTHEME/assets/images
folder.

body{
  background: image-url("SUB.png");
}
